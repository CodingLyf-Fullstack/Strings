/*
 * Problem: Find the maximum occurring (most frequent) character in a string.
 * Example: 
 * Input: "apple"
 * Output: "p"
 *
 * Approach:
 * 1. Use an integer frequency array of size 256 (to cover all ASCII characters).
 * 2. Traverse the string and count the frequency of each character.
 * 3. Traverse again to find the character with the highest frequency.
 * 4. Print that character.
 *
 * Why array[256]?
 * Because in Java, char is 16-bit Unicode, but for simplicity in interview-style
 * questions we usually assume ASCII (0â€“255).
